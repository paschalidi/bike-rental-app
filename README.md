# Bike reantal app

App is deployed and can be seen here https://bike-rental-app.vercel.app/

## Running the app locally

## Requirements

You will need to have the right env variables for firebase. I didn't include them because 
they are secrets and secrets like those are not supposed to be committed. 
You can contact me on `paschalidi@outlook.com` and I can pass you the secrets.

Otherwise you can see the app from this linkhttps://bike-rental-app.vercel.app/

## To run the app

After you got your secrets, run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
